VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The packaged ZIP archive is sourced via the project's page on Nir Sofer's website.
The project's page is located at the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifi_diagnostics_view.html

For convenience, the packaged archive was downloaded via the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifidiagnosticsview.zip

Note that the download URL is not versioned and will only serve the latest available
version. Therefore, this URL will only be a valid source if the latest available
version and packaged version are one and the same. A newly released version should be
expected to invalidate a checksum verification when downloading from this URL.

As a workaround, this package's creation process includes the creation of a historical
snapshot via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to create a permanent backup source.
This snapshot can be accessed at the following URL:
https://web.archive.org/web/20220818215106/https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifidiagnosticsview.zip

The following PowerShell command will print a calculated SHA256 hash:

    (Get-FileHash -Path wifidiagnosticsview.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash

This command should be executed against an independently downloaded archive, as well
as the copy distributed with the package. Both hash values should be identical. A
matching hash value should confirm that no corruption or tampering has occurred
during this package's generation process.

For reference, the following SHA256 hash was calculated during the package's automated creation:
154A7333A4A435857F664DF5810CD0C5353E5566A3FF34F24A2718D2F3B02899

VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The packaged ZIP archive is sourced via the project's page on Nir Sofer's website.
The project's page is located at the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifi_diagnostics_view.html

For convenience, the packaged archive was downloaded via the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifidiagnosticsview.zip

Nir Sofer also publishes official checksums for the packaged archive at the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/hash_check/?software=wifidiagnosticsview

Note that the download URL is not versioned, and that the checksums page only contains information
for the latest available version. Therefore, these URLs will only be a valid reference source if
the latest available version and packaged version are one and the same. A newly released version
should be expected to invalidate a checksum verification for an older version when using these URLs.

As a workaround, this package's creation process includes the creation of historical snapshots via
the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to create a permanent backup source.
These snapshots can be accessed at the following URLs:

Download: https://web.archive.org/web/20241126034328/https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifidiagnosticsview.zip
Checksums: https://web.archive.org/web/20241126034124/https://www.nirsoft.net/hash_check/?software=wifidiagnosticsview

For convenience, the following checksums were published at the time of this package's creation:
MD5: 3ae0f7f5bf834f5f9338ec177bfb3011
SHA1: 026347ee233141c215cf4d1f2012936779e767ae
SHA256: fcbac6f8d22f6c23480c8059d56fd8ccea47633afc917d64a3e4c48b512dec52
SHA512: 2726e3511280f55d0b41eaf8b3852d575e9d0efd79cb3515bd9f6aa070437d83f9ee2bc757a9a11bb837cd5ba4eefb577951303eecff424ec5ea71c380a4de10

Note that the MD5 and SHA1 hash algorithms are no longer considered secure by modern standards.
For tamper protection, it's recommended to validate against either a SHA256 or SHA512 hash instead.

The following PowerShell block will calculate and print a hash for each supported algorithm:

    $hashAlgorithms = @('MD5', 'SHA1', 'SHA256', 'SHA512')
    $hashAlgorithms | ForEach-Object { (Get-FileHash -Path wifidiagnosticsview.zip -Algorithm $_).Hash.ToLower() }

This block should be executed against an independently downloaded archive, as well as the copy
distributed with the package. All of the calculated hash values should match the published checksums.
Matching hash values should confirm that the published checksums are valid, and that no corruption or
tampering has occurred during this package's generation process.
